var event0 = "<h2>Prigosi Kalsov Announces Decolonisation Referendum</h2>\n<p style='text-indent: 25px;'>Earlier this week the President of Vsera, Prigosi Kalsov announced that all Vseran colonies will be holding an independence referendum. This is in response to rising protests and riots in Vseran colonies, many calling for independence. Although the bill is widely supported in the colonies, some Vseran executives, like Soklov Nabrosi, the CEO of the Cartigabian Tobacco Charter, voiced worry about the bill stating, 'This bill will shut down hundreds of colonial-based companies, and possibly send our country into an economic crisis.' Officials deny the risk of economic recession, saying that the government would bail out colonial-based companies while they transfer their products to domestic resources.</p>\n";
var event1 = "<h2>Vsiera Stock Exchange Reports High Losses After Cartigabian Secession</h2>\n<p style='text-indent: 25px;'>On Sunday, Cartigabia, and Platie were granted independence. The result of this was the mass selling of stocks when the Vsiera Stock Exchange opened on Monday. The Cartigabian Tobacco Charter, along with other Cartigabian and Platie-based companies have recieved financial aid from Vsera, but many economists worry that this could spell disaster. 'There was no preperation from either Vsera or the companies affected. Since the Domestic Commerce Act of 1931 limits the hiring of foreign workers, I see no way that these companies can survive. I forsee an extremely disastrous recession coming our way.' says financial expert Valkavi Esponov. The government in Vsiera still believes that the market can recover, and has not made any recovery plans.</p>\n";
